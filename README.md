This repo provides the implementation and visualisation of Dijkstra's algorithm.


Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a given graph.
<br>
<br>
This is a teaching tool that is used for easy visualization of Dijkstra's algorithm implemented using the Sigma JS library for graph drawing. 
<br> 
Run 
<code> python server.py </code> to start the applicaton. /Dijkstras1 is the flask endpoint for visualization of example 1 (in.in), /Dijkstras2 is the endpoint for visualization of example 2 (in1.in).

<h4> Input format </h4>
First line contains N - number of nodes, E - number of edges: <br>


*N E* <br>
The following E lines contain 3 integers describing each edge of the graph: <br>
*EdgeSource EdgeDestination EdgeWeight* <br>
The last line contains a source and destination for which the shortest path needs to be returned :<br>
*Src Dest* <br>

<h2> Screenshots </h2>
The node under consideration is colored blue.

The current adjacent node is colored yellow.

If a shorter path is found between two nodes it is showed with a green curved edge.
